<h1>Practice floats!</h1>
<div id="intro" class="instructions">
<p>Below are some images and paragraphs of text. For the sake of equal opportunity, both kittens and puppies have been provided. Each image and each paragraph has an id, so you can set style rules on each using the style section above. Float each image to the right or to the left, and see how it responds. Set margins and padding on each image and paragraph, try different values and see what happens. I've set some rules on the first image to set an example.</p>
<p>Once you've tried some different floats and margins, experiment with clear. Set clear on some paragraphs and see how they respond.</p>
<p>Experiment and try to find settings that create a nice, professional looking page of text.</p>

<p id="paragraph1">The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the  wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did  not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.</p>

<p id="paragraph2">'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'  <img src="http://placepuppy.it/150/150" id="image2" /> (she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were  animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said  this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of  it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her  age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done  just as well.</p>
<img src="http://placekitten.com/g/75/75" id="image3" />
<p id="paragraph3">The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they  doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put  down yet, before the trial's begun.'</p>

<p id="paragraph3">'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for  fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.' <img src="http://placepuppy.it/100/100" id="image4" /></p>
<img src="http://placekitten.com/g/50/50" id="image5" />
<p id="paragraph4">'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped  hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the  King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who  was talking.</p>
<img src="http://placepuppy.it/200/100" id="image6" />
<p id="paragraph5">Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,  that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,  and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell  'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice  muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</p>

<p id="paragraph6">One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice  could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and  very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. <img src="http://placekitten.com/g/175/150" id="image7" /> She did it so quickly  that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out  at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was  obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was  of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</p>

<p id="paragraph7">'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.</p>

<p id="paragraph8">On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then  unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:&mdash;</p>
